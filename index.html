<p>
Every once in a while, a new game genre gains popularity and captivates players all around the globe. Incremental games are one of the latest ones, evolving from the principle of accumulating resources over time.
</p>
 

<p>They are also a focal point of my Thesis project at the IT University of Copenhagen. For the experimental part I have prepared a simple incremental game for all of you to try out.  

<p> Every player is valuable, the ones who are new to the genre, the experienced ones, players who absolutely love incremental games and players who love them a little less. In whatever group you are, I suggest playing the game at least to reach a couple of upgrades (you can already stop pushing that mouse button after the second one and discover a new way of collecting drops!).  </p>

<p> When the drops start to accumulate on their own, youâ€™re kindly invited to fill in the questionnaire located below the game.  </p>
<p>Thank you and happy clicking!
